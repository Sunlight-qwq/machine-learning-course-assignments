Homework 3:

Given a maze as above, we will use Q-learning algorithm (see above) to find the best route from start cell to end cell. at each cell, agent can move to left or right or up or down by one cell, and receive a reward.

1. define parameter values (such as alpha, gamma, epsilon, reward when reaching boundary or blue wall cells or end cell) by yourself, but do follow common sense;
2. in the end of training, print out the greedy policy from start cell to end cell; also print out the total steps needed to finish (should be around 23) this;
3. use a random seed at the begining;
4. describe your parameters and game setup in the comments or just print to the screen;
5. you may work with others as a group (no more than 5 members); if this is the case, someone in the group need collect all .py files and send them to me using .zip format; do NOT use .rar format;
6. make sure your .py file can compile and work;
7. each submits only ONE .py file;  and please name it as studentID+name(+second).py;
8. please send them to my email address before 11:30 PM on May 28, 2022;
9. let me know if you have questions.
